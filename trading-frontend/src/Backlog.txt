Backlog:

    Back-end:
        -Print function
        -Save function
        -Export funtion (csv/exel/etc)
        -gracefully handle deleted and (recover / undo delete)
        - Add "Goals" to the DB. But not everone will have the same goals so how can I generalize it? it should relate to the networth or finanacial section.


    Front-end:

        Global:
            Loading Feature:
            -Give everything a loading and 'fade-In' feature. - DONE

            Mini-Trades Section:
            -Make it visible
            Calendar section:
            -Make it so the calendar modal shows all entries for that day but put it in a 'More details' link 
            that expands the modal and shows the details when clicked. (so that could be like trades/plans/anything withing that date.)
            -Make the cash values have a private (visible) option.

        Trades Page:
            Trades table:
            -Click to modify or delete each trade (create a security warning for deleting trades (Admin only))

            -Make it so its only the Plan shows up. - DONE
        Analysis Page:
            Bars Section:
            -Bars should be a histogram similar to the networth tracker chart
            -Replace that section with the Monthly Trades. Might have to create a new component

            Watchlist section: -DONE
            -Re-design the watchlist item display 
                -NoID above the symbol, entry date underneath the symbol, price information on the right
                -Plan on the center, date on far right, and the hit ot miss should just be sliding there on the watchlist. no need to click settings
            -Re-design the Watchlist information card.
            --new
            -Connect to a free API or Manually add Common named stocks. but print the actual name of the stock on the top right of where the ticker is on the watchlist.

            -Include a place for 'Biggest wins' or 'Biggest Loss' things like that, average contracts, etc.
        networth Page:
            histogram section:
            - Try out the line on the histogram first, if it doesn't look good becuase of the blue line dropping due to the $0.00 income on some weeks, then just let it enter the last 5 entries, or just show a filter
